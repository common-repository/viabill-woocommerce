ViaBill Gateway for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

ViaBill provides a seamless financing solution for thousands of merchants and customers across the world. Weâ€™re increasing average order sizes, providing low transaction costs and putting the customer in focus so they can get what they want when they want it; all of which benefits, you, the merchant.

ViaBill - WooCommerce is a plugin that allows you to make payments via ViaBill platform. You will be able to capture and refund your ViaBill orders directly in your back office and you can even activate the PriceTag. The PriceTag notifies the shoppers about the ability to finance their purchases long before they reach the checkout page, which ensures a higher conversion-rate and increased average basket size. The ViaBill PriceTag can be activated in the extension too.
